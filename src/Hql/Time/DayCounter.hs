        The 30\/360 day count can be calculated according to US, European, or
        Italian conventions.

        US (NASD) convention: if the starting date is the 31st of a
        month, it becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
        If the ending date is the 31st of a month and the starting
        date is earlier than the 30th of a month, the ending date
        becomes equal to the 1st of the next month, otherwise the
        ending date becomes equal to the 30th of the same month.
        Also known as \"30\/360\", \"360\/360\", or \"Bond Basis\"

        European convention: starting dates or ending dates that
        occur on the 31st of a month become equal to the 30th of the
        same month.
        Also known as \"30E\/360\", or \"Eurobond Basis\"

        Italian convention: starting dates or ending dates that
        occur on February and are grater than 27 become equal to 30
        for computational sake. -}

       \"Actual\/365 (Fixed)\" day count convention, also know as
        \"Act\/365 (Fixed)\", \"A\/365 (Fixed)\", or \"A\/365F\".

       According to ISDA, \"Actual\/365\" (without \"Fixed\") is
       an alias for \"Actual\/Actual (ISDA)\" (see
       ActualActual.)  If Actual\/365 is not explicitly
       specified as fixed in an instrument specification,
       you might want to double-check its meaning. -}
